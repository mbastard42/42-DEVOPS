# Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

## Overview

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a standard protocol for sending and receiving electronic mail (email) across networks. SMTP is used by mail servers to relay emails from senders to recipients and is a fundamental part of the email communication process. It defines how messages are sent and received, providing a reliable method for email transmission.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Client-Server Model:**
   - SMTP operates on a client-server model. Mail clients (email software) use SMTP to send messages, and mail servers use SMTP to relay and receive messages.

2. **Message Components:**
   - An email message consists of the message content and metadata, including sender and recipient addresses, subject, and additional headers.

3. **SMTP Commands:**
   - **HELO (or EHLO):** Initiates an SMTP session, and the client identifies itself to the server.
   - **MAIL FROM:** Specifies the sender's email address.
   - **RCPT TO:** Specifies the recipient's email address.
   - **DATA:** Indicates the start of the message data.
   - **QUIT:** Terminates the SMTP session.

4. **SMTP Responses:**
   - SMTP uses three-digit status codes to indicate the success or failure of a command. For example, "250 OK" indicates success.

5. **Relaying and Forwarding:**
   - SMTP servers relay emails to other servers until they reach the destination server. This involves multiple handoffs between SMTP servers.

6. **Port Number:**
   - SMTP typically uses port 25 for unencrypted communication. For secure communication, ports 465 (SMTPS) and 587 (submission) may be used.

## Security Considerations:

1. **SMTP over TLS (SMTPS):**
   - Adds a layer of encryption to SMTP communication, enhancing security. It typically uses port 465.

2. **STARTTLS Command:**
   - Enables opportunistic encryption by upgrading a plain text connection to an encrypted one during the SMTP session.

## Use Cases:

1. **Email Sending:**
   - SMTP is used to send emails from a sender's mail client to a recipient's mail server.

2. **Mail Server Communication:**
   - Mail servers use SMTP to relay emails between different domains.

3. **Email Forwarding:**
   - SMTP is involved in forwarding emails through multiple servers until they reach the intended destination.
