# Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

## Overview

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a fundamental protocol used for communication on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands. HTTP is the foundation of any data exchange on the web and enables the retrieval and display of hypertext-linked documents.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Client-Server Model:**
   - HTTP operates on a client-server model where a client (typically a web browser) sends requests to a server, and the server responds with the requested resources.

2. **Stateless Protocol:**
   - HTTP is stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server is independent, and the server does not retain information about the client's previous requests.

3. **Request Methods:**
   - **GET:** Requests data from a specified resource.
   - **POST:** Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
   - **PUT:** Updates a resource on the server.
   - **DELETE:** Deletes a specified resource.

4. **Response Status Codes:**
   - HTTP responses include status codes indicating the outcome of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).

5. **Headers:**
   - Both requests and responses include headers that provide additional information about the message, such as content type, length, and caching directives.

6. **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):**
   - Identifies the name or location of a resource on the web. URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are a type of URI.

## Secure Version - HTTPS:

- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP.
- It adds a layer of encryption using protocols like TLS (Transport Layer Security) to secure data transmission between the client and server.

## Use Cases:

1. **Web Browsing:**
   - HTTP is the protocol used for fetching web pages in browsers.

2. **API Communication:**
   - Many APIs use HTTP for communication between servers and clients.

3. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Retrieving resources such as images, documents, or data from a web server.

4. **Form Submissions:**
   - Submitting form data from a web page to a server using the HTTP POST method.
