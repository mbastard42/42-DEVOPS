# File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

## Overview

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of files between a client and a server on a computer network. FTP provides a simple and efficient way to upload, download, and manage files on remote servers. It operates on a client-server model where the client initiates connections to the server to perform file-related operations.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Client-Server Architecture:**
   - FTP follows a client-server architecture where the client initiates requests, and the server responds accordingly.

2. **Two Modes of Operation:**
   - **Active Mode:** The client opens a random port, and the server connects to it for data transfer.
   - **Passive Mode:** The server opens a random port, and the client connects to it for data transfer.

3. **FTP Commands:**
   - **USER:** Specifies the username for authentication.
   - **PASS:** Specifies the password for authentication.
   - **PWD:** Prints the current working directory.
   - **CWD:** Changes the current working directory.
   - **LIST:** Lists the files in the current directory.
   - **RETR:** Retrieves a file from the server to the client.
   - **STOR:** Stores a file from the client to the server.
   - **DELE:** Deletes a file on the server.
   - **QUIT:** Ends the FTP session.

4. **FTP Data Channels:**
   - FTP uses separate channels for command and data transmission. The command channel is used for sending commands, while the data channel is used for transferring files.

5. **Anonymous FTP:**
   - Allows users to log in with a generic username (usually "anonymous") without a password. It is often used for public file repositories.

## Security Considerations:

1. **FTP Over SSL/TLS (FTPS):**
   - Adds a layer of security by encrypting the FTP connection. FTPS can operate in implicit or explicit mode.

2. **SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP):**
   - Provides secure file transfer over an encrypted channel. SFTP is different from FTP and FTPS and is based on the SSH protocol.

## Use Cases:

1. **Web Development:**
   - Uploading and downloading website files between a local machine and a web server.

2. **File Sharing:**
   - Sharing files between users or groups within an organization.

3. **Software Distribution:**
   - Distributing software packages or updates to users or servers.

4. **Backup and Archiving:**
   - Transferring backup files to remote servers for storage.
