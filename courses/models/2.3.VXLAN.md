# Virtual Extensible Local Area Network (VXLAN)

VXLAN is a network protocol that enables the creation of virtualized extended networks within a physical network infrastructure. It was designed to address the needs of virtualization and cloud computing environments, where workload mobility and network flexibility are crucial.

## Here are some key points about VXLAN:

1. **VLAN Extension:** VXLAN extends the concept of VLANs by allowing the creation of thousands of network identifiers (called VXLAN IDs) instead of the 4096 limit imposed by VLANs. This resolves the issue of VLAN exhaustion in environments where numerous virtual networks are required.

2. **Encapsulation:** VXLAN encapsulates Ethernet frames into User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets to facilitate transmission over an existing IP network. This allows VXLAN packets to be routed across standard IP networks.

3. **Identification with VXLAN ID:** Each VXLAN uses a unique identifier called the VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) or VXLAN ID. This identifier is included in the VXLAN header and is used to identify the virtual network to which a frame belongs.

4. **Network Isolation:** VXLAN enables the logical isolation of different virtual networks, even if they share the same physical infrastructure. This facilitates the creation of virtual private networks (VPNs) within a shared environment.

5. **Support for Multi-Tenancy Environments:** VXLAN is particularly useful in cloud and service provider environments as it allows the creation of separate virtual networks for each tenant or customer while using a common physical infrastructure.

6. **Compatibility with Virtualization:** VXLAN is often used in conjunction with virtualization technologies such as VMware, OpenStack, and others. It enables virtual machines to communicate as if they were in the same physical network, even if deployed on different physical servers.
